## Overview
Many gym goers struggle with doing exercises in the right form and would benefit from form tracking and correction. However, it can be quite costly to hire a personal trainer to check their form, and often self teaching could lead to potential injury. The Squat Assistant aims to solve these issues by giving users a reliable and self-sufficient alternative which will inform and correct them when their squat form is incorrect.
