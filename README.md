## Overview
Many gym goers struggle with doing exercises in the right form and would benefit from form tracking and correction. However, it can be quite costly to hire a personal trainer to check their form, and often self teaching could lead to potential injury. The Squat Assistant aims to solve these issues by giving users a reliable and self-sufficient alternative which will inform and correct them when their squat form is incorrect.

## Instruction to run (PLZ EDIT)
This is currently only a simple html-css-js project. Frameworks may be added when the simplicity becomes a bottleneck. 
To run, download the repo and just start a simple server 
```
python -m http.server
```

Go to ```localhost:8000``` on Chrome to see the site (as opposed to 0.0.0.0:8000) as camera on Chrome only runs on https or localhost. Then click on the debug card. That has eval running.
